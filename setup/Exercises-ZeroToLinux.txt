"Directory Jeopardy!"
(Lab for Section 1, "Getting Around")
=====================================

1. How many ways can you think of to make a copy of /etc/passwd in /tmp?

2. What directory would you be in after you ran the following command:
   "cd ~/Pictures/.././.././../etc/systemd/../../var/log/.././../../../../../.."

3. What directory are you in after the following commands:

   	cd ~/Downloads
	cd ../../../etc/pam.d
	cd /tmp
	cd ../../../var/log
	cd
	cd ..

4. How few keystrokes can you use to "cd /var/run/NetworkManager/system-connections/"?

5. Use the "cd" command to descend as far as possible under "Targets/PtP" in order to discover
   the full text of the "phrase that pays".
	


"Only Seven Commands? No Worries!"
(Lab for Section 2, "Basic Commands")
=====================================

1. Under /var/log:

      What is the most recently modified file?
      What file is least recently modified (oldest) file?
      What is the file size of the smallest file?
      How many bytes are in the largest file?
      How many megabytes is the largest file?

2. What is the command to make directories? (HINT: Try "man -k")

3. You want to make a directory called "/tmp/fee/fie/fo/fum"-- how can you do this with a
   single command? (HINT: get some experience reading Linux manual pages)

4. The directory "Targets/Pictures" contains files with .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, and .png extensions.
   Make three directories under ~/Pictures for GIF, JPG, and PNG files and then copy the files
   from "Targets/Pictures" into their appropriate destinations. Note that both the .jpg and .jpeg
   files should end up in ~/Pictures/JPG!

5. Search through your command line history for three commands containing the letters "help".
   What are they?

6. Now become the root user and search root's command history for "help" commands. What are they?

7. Can you find the same commands in your history using string searching in less?


"Learning to Linux"
(Lab for Section 3, "Building Blocks")
======================================

1. List all file names under /usr/include that contain the string "sockaddr_in".

2. How many matching files are there?

3. How many files are in "Targets/Pictures"?

4. "Targets/Pictures" contains files with four different extensions: .gif, .jpeg, .jpg, and .png.
   Run a single command line that tells you how many files there are of each extension. Confirm
   that you have the correct number of files in the directories you made under ~/Pictures in the
   previous lab section.

5. "md5sum" computes an MD5 hash on its input. How many unique md5 hashes are there for the files
   in "Targets/Pictures"?

6. "ps -ef" lists all of the currently running processes on the system. The first column is the
   user who the process is running as. Count the number of processes for each user and display
   the results in sorted order.

7. If you look closely at your output from the previous question you will probably see a line that
   reads "1 UID". This is actually coming from the header of the "ps -ef" output:

        $ ps -ef 
        UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
        root           1       0  0 Apr16 ?        00:00:20 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root ...
        root           2       0  0 Apr16 ?        00:00:01 [kthreadd]
	[...]

   How can you get rid of this unwanted data in your output?

8. The file "Targets/ip_addrs" contains IP addresses in random order. Sort the file numerically by the
   numbers in each octet. Why doesn't a simple "sort -n" work?

9. Write a pipeline to output the 25th line (and only the 25th line) of a file. You can test your command
   on the file "Targets/numbered_lines". (HINT: maybe "head" and "tail" could help here?)

10. "Targets/access_log-hudak" is a web access log from an exploited web server. Often attackers launch exploits
    from a command-line tool like "curl". Output the IPs using any version of curl in sorted order based on the
    number of times the IP address appears in the file. (HINT: since awk uses "/.../" for pattern match, if you
    want to match a literal "/" you need to enter it as "\/")

11. The file "Targets/psscan-output" contains output from the Volatility memory forensics "psscan" plugin.
    This plugin is excellent at finding data about processes running (or which ran recently) on the system,
    but it often produces redundant process info because of the way data gets moved and copied around in memory.
    The first column in the output indicates the memory offset where the process structure was found and the
    rest of the line is data about the process. Can you reduce the output to just the lines that are unique
    from the second field onwards, ignoring the memory offset information in column one? (HINT: look at the
    answer to question #5)

12. "Targets/names" contains data on the top 100 most popular male and female names based on data
    from the United States Social Security Administration for the years 1920-2021. Extract the two names
    from each line of data and output an alphabetically sorted file with one name per line.
